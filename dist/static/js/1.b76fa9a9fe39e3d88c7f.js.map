使用css类needsclick，解决fackclick与better-scroll点击事件冲突问题\r\n* 4. 最外层即news一定要使用fixed定位，scroll要设置height为100%，overflow为hidden\r\n* 5. scroll子组件使用emit触发父组件的方法时，要用v-on绑定不能用@\r\n* 6. 因为图片是异步加载的，为了保证scroll对滚动区域的大小计算准确，img标签需要预先设置好宽高或css样式，width=\"60\" height=\"60\"\r\n* 7. 原理是最外层的父元素宽高固定，当scroll计算好滚动区域的宽高后，如过大于外层父元素的宽高才会产生滚动，否则不能产生局部滚动，异步的图片尺寸宽高要用固定值，不要百分比\r\n* 8. 为什么父元素要使用fixed定位，因为BScroll要求要父元素的高度要固定，由子元素的高度去撑开它\r\n**/\r\nimport Slider from 'components/slider/slider'\r\nimport Scroll from 'components/scroll/scroll'\r\nimport Loading from
